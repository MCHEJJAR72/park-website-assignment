Here is a basic design concept for a landing page for a neighborhood park:

Name: Oakwood Park

Objective: To create an online presence for Oakwood Park that showcases its facilities, amenities, and events, while providing easy access to information and encouraging visitors to visit the park.

Design:

The design will utilize Bootstrap to create a responsive, mobile-friendly layout. The landing page will have a clean and modern design, with a focus on showcasing the park's features and amenities.

Navbar:
A fixed-top navbar will be created using Bootstrap's navbar component. The navbar will include links to the park's main pages, such as "About", "Facilities", "Events", and "Contact".
Hero Section:
A hero section will be created at the top of the page, featuring a large photo of the park's scenic landscape. The photo will be a responsive image, and will be used to visually communicate the park's natural beauty.
Photo Gallery:
A photo gallery will be added below the hero section, featuring a selection of photographs showcasing the park's facilities, amenities, and events. The gallery will be created using Bootstrap's carousel component, with pagination and responsive design.
Map:
A map image will be added below the photo gallery, featuring the park's location and boundaries. The map will be static, but will provide an overall view of the park's layout and surrounding area.
Content Sections:
Below the map, there will be content sections providing more information about the park's facilities, amenities, and events. Each section will have a distinct heading, and will feature text, images, and possibly icons or other graphics.
Call-to-Action:
A call-to-action (CTA) button will be added at the bottom of the page, encouraging visitors to visit the park or learn more about upcoming events.
Design Elements:

Colors: #3498db (primary blue), #f1c40f (secondary orange), and #f5f5f5 (neutral white)
Typography: Open Sans, a modern sans-serif font
Fonts: Font sizes and styles will be adjusted to create a clear hierarchy of information
Imagery: High-quality images will be used throughout the site, with a focus on showcasing the park's natural beauty and amenities
Icons: Font Awesome icons will be used to add visual interest and emphasize key points
Layout:

The layout will be designed using a 12-column grid system provided by Bootstrap. The grid will be used to create a clear hierarchy of information, with emphasis on the hero section and photo gallery.

Code:

Here is a basic code structure for the landing page:
